Pijanowski. 2012. Pumilio: A Web-Based Management System for Ecological Recordings. Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America 93: 71-81. doi: [10.1890/0012-9623-93.1.71](http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9623-93.1.71)\r\n\r\nPumilio is a free and open source PHP/MySQL application for the management of sound archives and the visualization and manipulation of sound files. The system allows the user to load sound files in many formats, see the spectrogram of the sound, select regions of the sound for further analysis and insertion in a database, filtering, and many other manipulations.\r\n\r\nAll that is needed to browse and navigate the archive in the application is a modern browser with JavaScript and either Adobe Flash or HTML5. This means that it will work with the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, and newer versions of current browsers without Flash installed. The application has been tested with all recent versions of Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Chrome.\r\n\r\nThe concept of this application is to use a graphical front-end to edit, manipulate, convert, visualize and extract information of sound files. The code uses several scripts and command-line programs to achieve its purposes.\r\n\r\nThe major intended audience of the application is bioacoustics research groups. Other groups that may be interested include people interested in sounds, musicians, wildlife and nature sounds fans, and many more.\r\n\r\n[Demo of Pumilio](http://pumilio.coquipr.com/pumilio/)\r\n\r\nHave ideas, suggestions, or want to contribute code? All help is welcomed, just send an email to ljvillanueva@coquipr.com or using the Github system.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VMware virtual machine is available at this location (NOTICE: The zip file is 1.4 GB). The VM requires the free VMWare Player version 3 or higher (or another compatible software). Please read the README file or post your questions in the help forum.\r\nThe application will continue to be in active development to add new features and improve its performance. If you want to contribute to the development, please visit the Developer Section of SourceForge.\r\n\r\n## R package ##\r\n\r\nA new package for R, [pumilioR](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pumilioR), is available from CRAN that allows to query a Pumilio system, version 2.6.0 or newer, and get a data frame with the data. \r\n\r\n## Download Pumilio ##\r\n\r\n##Change history##\r\n\r\n###The last release to date is 2.6.1 (Sep 3, 2013)###\r\n\r\nNew for release 2.6.1:\r\n* Reconfigured options of the spectrogram images, in particular adding a way to change the FFT window.\r\n* Moved some database calls to the abstraction layer.\r\n\r\nNew for release 2.6.0:\r\n* New version of the xml file to allow query from pumilioR.\r\n* Fixed a number of bugs.\r\n\r\nNew for release 2.5.4:\r\n* Updated a deprecated sox effect (filter, replaced by sinc).\r\n* Fixed a number of bugs.\r\n\r\nNew for release 2.5.3:\r\n* Added a database layer to some of the code.\r\n* Cleaned up some of the code.\r\n* Fixed a number of bugs.\r\n\r\nNew for release 2.5.2:\r\n* Fixed a few bugs in version 2.5.1 that did not pointed to the correct path in some scripts.\r\n\r\nNew for release 2.5.1:\r\n* Fixed a few bugs in version 2.5.0 that did not followed the current permission system, could deny access even when set to allow it.\r\n\r\nNew for release 2.5.0:\r\n* Added option for external authentication, in particular using Wordpress.\r\n* Added option to always show particular KML layers in map.\r\n* Cleaned up some of the code.\r\n\r\nNew for release 2.4.2:\r\n* Fixed a bug in the add files system that parsed incorrectly the time when the file was made.\r\n\r\nNew for release 2.4.1:\r\n* Exclusive use of v3 of the Google Maps API.\r\n* Simplified size calculation for exporting files.\r\n\r\nNew for release 2.4.0:\r\n* Added the option to use Google Maps v3.

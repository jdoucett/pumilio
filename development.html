        <h2>Development</h2>
      </div>

<h3>How this came to be</h3>
	<p>Pumilio was created out of necessity. Our lab was collecting a lot of sound data and there was no
	system that could help us manage that amount of data. In addition, we used at least two operating systems (Windows and Linux) 
	and some collaborators even use Mac. On top of that, some of us used Internet Explorer, while some used Firefox.
	<p>We started just putting files in folders in a network share. After a few hundred files there is no way of keeping track. Plus, 
	we were wasting time each time we had to open a file in Audacity or Raven to see its spectrogram. 
	
<h3>First steps</h3>
	<p>One of the first instances of this system was a simple database that would display rows of spectrograms with a Flash mp3 player
	on the bottom of each. Similar to the "gallery" view of the current version of Pumilio. The problem was generating all those spectrograms.
	Using R was easy, but took too long to write the png files. The function specgram() in Python crashed with our files (15 minutes). After 
	a while, I stumbled upon a Python script written by the people of Freesound.org. This was a very fast script and I took it and 
	implemented it.
	<p>Afterwards it was all step by step. A JavaScript plugin built to crop images over the web became a selection tool for 
	zooming in a sound and filtering.
	<p>For a while, the development was done in an open way using subversion in SourceForge. 

<h3>Current development</h3>
	<p>Pumilio is now managed using git in a Github repo. If you want to contribute, just check the code in the project's website.
	Any and all ideas are welcomed. Let me know if you want to be added to the developer list. 
	<p><strong>Do not use the dev code for a production system. The code may be buggy, unstable or completely useless. Use the git repo only for 
	development.</strong>

<h3>General philosophy on how the application is built</h3>
	<p>The main idea is to make it easy to navigate a sound archive using any modern computer. This means using cross-browser 
	tools to allow the use of any modern browser. Blueprint enables a consistent CSS, JQuery takes care of most of the JavaScript and 
	some of the styling.

<h3>What is needed in the code?</h3>
	<p>Everything. The code is built to withstand most cases of human error, human stupidity, and attacks. However, it can use everything
	from improvements in the PHP and JavaScript code, usability improvements, database structure, to faster and better Python scripts. 
	Lend a hand to help build a better scientific tool.

<h3>The MySQL database for v.2.7.1</h3>

	<p>Some notes about the database. At version 26 of the database, there are 28 tables and the structure is as follows:

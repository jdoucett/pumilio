The name "pumilio" refers to the tropical frog known as the Strawberry Poison-dart
 Frog (Oophaga pumilio), a bold little critter that sings during the day without
 fear of being predated upon.

Feel free to contribute code, ideas, suggestions, bugs, etc.

Read the INSTALLATION file to install and the UPGRADE file to upgrade.

To prevent access to the original sound files from the web (for example, someone trying to 
 download your whole dataset), rename the file "htaccess" to ".htaccess" (starting with a period)
 and place it in the main folder of the application.
 The apache server must be configured to allow this option. 

 In Ubuntu:
 ```bash
  sudo a2enmod rewrite
  sudo service apache2 restart
  ```
 For other distros or options, please consult your administrator.

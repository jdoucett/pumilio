To install, just copy the files to a webserver folder. This application
 is written in PHP5.

The folder /tmp must have write permissions for the webserver to create the
 necessary temporary files.

The folder /sounds must have write permissions for the webserver.

The svt.py script requires Python 2.4+, numpy 1.1+ (http://numpy.scipy.org/),
 and audiolab 0.08
 (http://www.ar.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/david/softwares/audiolab/index.html).

 If you have problems installing audiolab, try version 0.8:
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.audiolab/0.8

SoX version 14.3.0 or higher is required. To install in Ubuntu:
 If a version less than 14.3.0 is installed, get the latest version from http://sox.sourceforge.net/

Other required programs include Imagemagick, Python Imaging, and FLAC.



To install the required packages for in a current version of Ubuntu:
 sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy python-setuptools libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev sox libsox-fmt-* imagemagick python-imaging flac python-mysqldb lame
 
 Then, install the audiolab module.
 

Upload file size limit is determined in the php.ini file. In Ubuntu the file is located
 in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
 Set the desired value in the variables upload_max_filesize and post_max_size, then restart Apache:
  sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
 Please consult the PHP manual for more info:
  - http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.upload-max-filesize
  - http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.post-max-size





#CONFIGURATION
Once the files have been copied to a web server, rename the file config.php.dist to config.php
 and edit the appropriate fields.
 
Then, go to pumilio/install with your browser to see if all requirements have been met
 and to create an administrator user. After setting up that account you can delete the install/ folder.

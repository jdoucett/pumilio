<p>Citation: Villanueva-Rivera, Luis J., and Bryan C. Pijanowski. 2012. Pumilio: A Web-Based Management System for Ecological Recordings. Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America 93: 71-81. doi: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9623-93.1.71">10.1890/0012-9623-93.1.71</a></p>

<p>Pumilio is a free and open source PHP/MySQL application for the management of sound archives and the visualization and manipulation of sound files. The system allows the user to load sound files in many formats, see the spectrogram of the sound, select regions of the sound for further analysis and insertion in a database, filtering, and many other manipulations.</p>

<p>All that is needed to browse and navigate the archive in the application is a modern browser with JavaScript and either Adobe Flash or HTML5. This means that it will work with the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, and newer versions of current browsers without Flash installed. The application has been tested with all recent versions of Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Chrome.</p>

<p>The concept of this application is to use a graphical front-end to edit, manipulate, convert, visualize and extract information of sound files. The code uses several scripts and command-line programs to achieve its purposes.</p>

<p>The major intended audience of the application is bioacoustics research groups. Other groups that may be interested include people interested in sounds, musicians, wildlife and nature sounds fans, and many more.</p>

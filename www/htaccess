#If you want to avoid hotlinking or people trying to download the files without 
# a legitimate reason, rename this file to .htaccess (starting with a dot) and
# change the 'server.com' below to the address of the server.
# This requires the Apache rewrite module. In Ubuntu, enable with:
#  sudo a2enmod rewrite
#  sudo service apache2 restart
#
# Make sure Apache allows htaccess files. In the configuration file, 
#  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
# make sure the AllowOverride option is like this:
#  AllowOverride All

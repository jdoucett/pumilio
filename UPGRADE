To upgrade Pumilio from version 1.0, or newer, replace the files with the last release,
 without replacing the following folders:
    * sounds
    * tmp
    * sitephotos
    * data_sources (if you added something)
    * plugins (if you added something)
    * tools (if you added something)

Check config.php.dist to see if new variables are not present in your config.php file.
 Some options have been moved to the administration page in the application. Then go
 to the application address /upgrade (if the address is http://somehost.com/pumilio,
 then go to http://somehost.com/pumilio/upgrade). This will upgrade the database
 structure and make all necessary checks. IF YOU MISS THIS STEP, THE SYSTEM MAY NOT
 WORK AS INTENDED. 

UPGRADE TO v2.0.0
 Any upgrade from v 1.x to version 2.x will delete all images (spectrograms and waveforms). 
 This is necessary to mantain consistency. After upgrading, go to the Maintenance tab in
 the Admin menu and click on "Generate mp3 and image files."
